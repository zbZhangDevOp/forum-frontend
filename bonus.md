Interactive Likes Display
Functionality: Clicking on the like text/icon next to a thread or comment triggers a dropdown or modal (depending on the implementation) that lists all users who have liked the respective content.
Design: Designed with a user-first approach, the UI elements are intuitive and seamlessly integrate with the existing design language of the application. The likes display is visually appealing, promoting user engagement.
Real-Time Updates
Live Updates: The list of users who have liked a thread or comment is updated in real time. This means that when a new like is added, it immediately appears in the likes display for all users viewing that content, without the need for them to refresh the page.
Implementation: This real-time functionality is achieved through the use of JavaScript intervals and server-side checks to fetch new likes. This ensures that the content remains dynamic and reflects the most current data.
